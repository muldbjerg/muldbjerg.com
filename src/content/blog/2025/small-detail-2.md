description: Using selected text for a little disco
---

Clicking on stuff behind my desk I found a little detail today.
I landed up at [wearecollins.com](https://www.wearecollins.com/) - nice look and all.
But I sometimes select the text I'm reading, and then this happened:

<br>

<video controls autoplay>

  <source src="/blog/2025/selector-detail.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<br>

The rest of the site is all black and white.
So it took me by surprise.

A little disco detail ðŸª©
