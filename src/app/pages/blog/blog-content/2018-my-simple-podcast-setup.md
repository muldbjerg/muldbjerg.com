I’m crazy about pocast! And maybe therefore I have started my own.

I listen to podcast all the time. Biking to work, while vacuuming, and when I’m in the shower. Some would properly say – too much.

The perfect opportunity for starting one arrived with being a volunteer at the general assembly for the Danish YMCA-Scouts. I’m the leader of the organising group, where 450 scout leaders will be gathered at Gram Slot next weekend.

My one-rule was that the podcast setup had to be simple and take-it-out-into-the-world ready.

So, the only thing I invested in was good microphones. Even good podcast company can be ruined by bad sound. After disproportionately many reviews and blog post, the microphone I chose was Samson Q2U.

After 6 episodes of experience, I would highly recommend them. Good sound and super easy to work with.   I record directly into Garageband on my Macbook. With 2 audio tracks, one for each microphone. I used this guide: [A tale of two microphones](https://www.macworld.com/article/2089460/a-tale-of-two-microphones.html).

Before the first episode I talked with one of my friends about getting the podcast on Apple Podcast for iOS users. He had heard it was really difficult. But it really wasn’t.

I use the free wordpress plugin [Blubrry PowerPress](https://da.wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/). It spits out a RSS feed, with the right images and all. And then just go to [Apple Podcast to register it](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/login?module=PodcastsConnect&hostname=podcastsconnect.apple.com&cf=1&targetUrl=%2F&authResult=FAILED). For other devices you can just enter the RSS url.

To make the podcast extra crisp, I got my music savvy brother-in-law to create a nice jingle for the intro and outtro.
