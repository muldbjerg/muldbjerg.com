excerpt: Our project installation was shown at Dokk1, to experience your filter bubble. And if anyone manipulated it.

The sprint is over. It got ready!

The installation I have worked on for the last couple of months – “Welcome home” was displayed at Dokk1 in Aarhus this week. I designed it together with my group at IT Product Development. [I already have written about the installation](/blog/step-into-your-filter-bubble).

The finishing touches was done at the location. All of the wires was hidden away. Multiple Raspberry Pi connected to the network, and hidden under the table. And 2 projectors was calibrated to project on the sides of the dome.

Despite it being Jonas‘ nightmare – the prototype survived the many people trying it. Some of which was attending Internet Week Denmark talks at Dokk1. Others being any prototype-makers most feared group of testers – children.

The ReactJS apps I had development worked perfectly. And our hardware was able to keep up.

As part of the project, we did user evaluation of our installation. I had multiple interesting talks with people testing the installation – both regarding filter bubbling, the concept, my education as a IT Product Developer and GDPR.
