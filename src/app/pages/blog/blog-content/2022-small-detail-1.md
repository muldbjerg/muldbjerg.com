excerpt: Jessica Hische is amazing at lettering - and did something amazing at her website.

Jessica Hische is amazing at lettering. I enjoyed her book ‘In Progress’ and it's packed with small tips and tricks. 

I just tripped over this great small detail on her website. It’s not even on the page. But in the url:

<img src="/assets/blog/2022/jessicahische.is_awesome.webp" alt="Browser adress bar showing: jessicahische.is/awesome" height="60px"/>
<br/>

This is her index page: [jessicahische.is/awesome](https://www.jessicahische.is/awesome). I love the brag.

<br/>

The last - and maybe the best. This is the url for her “About” page:

It’s so simple, an almost no-effect little detail. But it's great as a funny twist. And when you start noticing it you have to checking all the pages.
