Sometimes I start on paper. Other times I go straight to Illustrator. These Icons are designed for a book I did together with other scouts.

It was handed out to young scout leaders at a leadership and communication education. I also taught at this education.

I’m a proud citizen of Aarhus. And I made these famous landmarks into icons, as a part of a project for ÅUF. Which is an organization for local groups in Aarhus.

These icons were made for a promoting education for scouts. They were used on small pins, in materials and on social media.
