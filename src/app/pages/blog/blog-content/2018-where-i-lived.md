I set myself a small assignment. Design something you know all about. What came to me, was drawing the houses I have lived in throughout my life.

It’s places I have biked home to every day. After a day in school, or at the office. Place I traveled away from, only to come home to again. These house have each had a massive impact on me. And therefore much sentimental value.

This is my list so far:
