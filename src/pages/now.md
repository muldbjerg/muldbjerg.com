<p id="update-message">Updated 8. January 2026 from my bed in Silkeborg</p>

Since December I’m easing into a new manager role for a couple of the good people at KeyShot, alongside some SCRUM and UX work. Learning leadership gradually really suits me well. I also finished the first module of a diploma in leadership and enjoy digging into the foundations.

## Keep designing things

Exploring ideas and making them real turns out to be really good for me. These days that’s small videos, making vinyl cuts, and tiny zines.

Lately I’m listening a lot to [APACHA](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Ppbc55kNdjvxP8Tw2P8S9?si=oVAG48nAStCdvXcNf_Gnmg). The line ["For jeg synes du er dejlig ogs' når du er en smule mærkelig"](https://open.spotify.com/track/0nVUuzrVZc5t9S48ifesg6?si=9ece1f98c3724ae0)! Roughly: I think you are wonderful even when you are a bit weird.

I'm rewatching [The Office](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/) with my wife. Still soo funny. I’ll also give a shout-out to "[Manden i hullet](https://www.dr.dk/drtv/saeson/manden-i-hullet_552589)" - geek mythology made both exciting and funny.

My kids are growing. Fast. The older one is in school, fascinated by letters and reading. The younger one is now 2,5 and very much becoming his own person. It feels like the end of having Super-Small Kids™.
