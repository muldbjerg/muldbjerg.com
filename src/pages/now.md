## Transitioning into fulltime scrum master

Since summer I have been transitioning from part frontend developer/scrum master to fulltime scrum master still at [KeyShot](https://www.keyshot.com/).
I now have 2 teams - the team building KeyShot Studio and the team building webservices around it.

## Exploring the world at home

The kids are age 1,5 and 5.
The youngest is learning so fast and copying everything.
The oldest one is into letters and writing.
Sometimes mirrored.
And the imagination.
It both getting so cool and scary.
Arts and crafts skills → through the roof.

## Being a meeting scout

Currently chair for the [YMCA-Scouts of Silkeborg](https://www.silkeborggruppe.dk/).
Mostly meetings and mails.
I build a [new website](https://www.silkeborggruppe.dk/) for it.
It launched in August.
The main goal was to make it easy to join and become a scout.

## Football, politics, design, tech and history

I still follow a lot of different podcasts.
Now additions is [Deep Dives](https://www.dive.club/deep-dives) (#design) and [The Rest Is Politics US](https://tripus.supportingcast.fm/) (#politics).
And stables like [Mediano](https://www.mediano.nu/) (#football), [Kongerækken](https://www.kongeraekken.dk/) (#history).

The music is [the Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXdwF9DytRe8w?si=cxEok2zHT8uOA4icKGzeKw), [Barselona](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2wdsck730u8ZhDA7eVHw7m?si=cdfUVE8fToCESmFozSEMyw), random pop tones.
And whatever's cool in the kindergarten this week.

## Into Opera?

Just started seeing [Operarejsen](https://www.dr.dk/drtv/saeson/operarejsen_287487) (The Opera Journey) and it's promising.
Adding multiple operas on the bucket list.

Last december was old film with Dirk Passer.
