It is about 200 pages and full of good tips and tricks. And still quick to go through.\n\nI started like: “I will just look at a few pages in bed”. But ended up standing out of bed and finishing it the same night.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n**Here is 5 of the Austin’s great tips:**\n\n\n![Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-book.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 1. Sharing in your workflow\nIs it really good enough to be shared yet? It’s easier to keep working on a project – and that’s sometimes the right thing to do. But according to Austin Kleon, the most successful creatives have sharing as a part of their workflow.\n\nHe has a blog where he shares a little thing every day. It keeps you moving on days, where it doesn’t come by itself. Let your work out.     \n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 2. Learn > Teach > Repeat\nTeaching others what you just learned helps you better understand it yourself. And because you’re not (yet) a longtime expert, will make it easier to tech the essential in a down to earth fashion.\n\nMaking it easier for others to learn too. So please, share what you learned.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n![Image of rows from Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-rows.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 3. Give some of your time\nAustin Kleon (and myself include) are not all that crazy about networking event. But he would still like to get to know inspiring people. His answer – social media.\n\nSocial media are a 2-wayed street. So, you can use it to get feedback, inspiration, chat with others. But remember to give back some of your time to your network. Share your thoughts, tips and try making others smile.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 4. Remember to give credit\nA simple tip – always remember to give credit. Mark where you get your inspiration. Who helped you. Where texts/images/graphics are from.\n\nIt makes sure you are on good terms with other people. And you can help others with their inspiration trail.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n![Of words 'Go on Google me' from Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-clip.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 5. Show process\nThe book emphasizes: don’t just share the results – show how you got there. The process is often the most interesting. Getting to look over the shoulder of other designers, developers, creatives. Getting to see how they tackle an obstacle.\n\nSo share your early sketches, old iterations of a logo, the perfect cup of coffee bringing the project over the goal line. Show it.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n![Of title 'Think process, not product' from Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-think-process.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\nThe book is easy to read.

It is hard work to save a web project, after it’s ended.\n\nI’m for one don’t enjoy keeping old website CMS’ up-to-date and secure, when they are no longer being used.\n\nLast year I built a website for the YMCA-Scouts general assembly, and the next assembly in 2020 needs a new website and new content. The challenge I face is saving the information from the website, to be able to go back a see what happened and was discussed the last time.\n\nThe website is built with WordPress, so first I looked for WordPress plugins to make it into static HTML pages. I tried [Simply Static](https://da.wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/) and [WP2Static](https://da.wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/). No luck.\n\nEither the links didn’t work. The styling wasn’t included, and one translated to a wrong character set. So, the Danish letter from the side wasn’t right. It spit this out:\n\n![A website where the styling is missing](/blog/2021/error_when_saving_website.webp)\n\n## HTTrack – just what I needed\n\nI started correcting the wrong characters – page for page. But there needed to be a better method. The combined guys of the internet said HTTrack, but it didn’t seem worth the trouble.\n\nBut it still better than correcting the characters of æ, ø and å on 40+ pages. And it was easy – and worked perfectly. It’s even available for all platforms.\n\n![Laptop on a table with a website open](/blog/2021/httrack-the_saved_website.webp)\n\n## Finally, here is the guide for HTTrack\n\n**1. Open your terminal**\n\n**2. Download HTTrack with brew**\n\n`brew install httrack`\n\n**3. Now you can use HTTrack– then enter:**\n\n`httrack \"https://[INSERT DOMAIN]\" -O \"[INSERT DESTINATION]\" \"+[INSERT FOLDER NAME]*\" -v`\n\nSo the command I entered was:\n\n`httrack \"https://landsmoede.dk/\" -O \"/Downloads/landsmoede.dk\" \"+landsmoede.dk/*\" -v`\n\nRemember to change it to your need. And be aware if it’s http or https.\n\nWhen it finished downloading everything is available as simple HTML pages.\n\nI put the save website at [2018.landsmoede.dk](http://2018.landsmoede.dk/), so the old version was saved. And the domain was ready to a new website.\n\nHTTrack can be used great, if you’re like me and changing portfolios all the time, it can help save old versions in your archives.","src/content/blog/2019/how-you-save-your-websites-forever.md","090070ff7a276d5b",{"html":347,"metadata":348},"\u003Cp>As a digital type, that spreads design, code and content across the internet.
