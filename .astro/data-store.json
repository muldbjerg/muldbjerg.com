But ended up standing out of bed and finishing it the same night.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n**Here is 5 of the Austin’s great tips:**\n\n\n![Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-book.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 1. Sharing in your workflow\nIs it really good enough to be shared yet? It’s easier to keep working on a project – and that’s sometimes the right thing to do. But according to Austin Kleon, the most successful creatives have sharing as a part of their workflow.\n\nHe has a blog where he shares a little thing every day. It keeps you moving on days, where it doesn’t come by itself. Let your work out.     \n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 2. Learn > Teach > Repeat\nTeaching others what you just learned helps you better understand it yourself. And because you’re not (yet) a longtime expert, will make it easier to tech the essential in a down to earth fashion.\n\nMaking it easier for others to learn too. So please, share what you learned.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n![Image of rows from Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-rows.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 3. Give some of your time\nAustin Kleon (and myself include) are not all that crazy about networking event. But he would still like to get to know inspiring people. His answer – social media.\n\nSocial media are a 2-wayed street. So, you can use it to get feedback, inspiration, chat with others. But remember to give back some of your time to your network. Share your thoughts, tips and try making others smile.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 4. Remember to give credit\nA simple tip – always remember to give credit. Mark where you get your inspiration. Who helped you. Where texts/images/graphics are from.\n\nIt makes sure you are on good terms with other people. And you can help others with their inspiration trail.\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n![Of words 'Go on Google me' from Austin Kleon's book \"Show your work\"](/blog/2021/Show-your-work-clip.webp)\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n## 5. Show process\nThe book emphasizes: don’t just share the results – show how you got there. The process is often the most interesting. Getting to look over the shoulder of other designers, developers, creatives. Getting to see how they tackle an obstacle.\n\nSo share your early sketches, old iterations of a logo, the perfect cup of coffee bringing the project over the goal line.

So every images should be compress before they are used on a website.\n\nAn example is taking the same image from 5.1 MB to 230 KB, without losing to much detail. That's great for loading time, hosting storage and even climate impact.\n\nThis post ends with my new script for easily optimizing images for the web. So hang on.\n\n## Formates\n\nI often use PNG's - e.g. if there are text on the image, PNG is the right way to go. Or there are transparent area - PNG support it. JPG doesn't. But now I convert all PNG's and JPG to WEBP - a newer formate by Google - with [good browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=webp).\n\nIt can be transparent. And the best thing - it's small.\n\nFor all vector graphics - go with SVG. Great size-wise. And then it's always crisp. [How to use SVG is a long story though](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html).\n\n## My too-many-clicks old approach\n\nThis was my way to optimize PNG's and JPG's for web.\n\nAnd it involved a lot of dragging, clicking, uploading, downloading....\n\n1. I uploaded my image to be optimized with [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com). Great tool by the way.\n\n2. Downloaded the optimized image. Now smaller, but still PNG/JPG.\n\n3. Uploaded the same optimized image to convertio to convert to WEBP formate.\n\n4. Download the image again - now in WEBP.\n\n5. (Uploaded the WEBP image to TinyPNG to take a little more of the file size.)\n\nThat's okay when it's just sometimes - and I got what I wanted. Small images ready for web. Fast download and all that.\n\nBut already with 3 images the process becomes so long. I did this for a long time, small images are important - but so is my time...\n\n## So I made a script\n\nAutomating it should be possible. I have created a few bash scripts - so I figured it was a way to make it a one step process instead.\n\nAnd here you go, here is my script. It could be improved. But with this [tutorial on running bash script from anywhere on your mac](https://www.simplykyra.com/how-to-run-a-bash-script-from-anywhere-on-your-apple-computer/), it was fast to get done.\n\nHere is the script - optimize-img.sh:\n\n\u003Cbr/>\n\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# A script to make images ready for the web\n\n# USE:\n# optimize-img.sh [---PATH-TO-IMAGE---]\n\n# Dependencies:\n# - JQ | Install: brew install jq\n# - wget | Install: brew install wget\n# - webp | Install: brew install webp\n\n\n# Saves variables\nIMAGE_PATH=$1\nORG_FILE_NAME=\"${IMAGE_PATH%.*}\"\nPNG_TEMP=optim.png\n\n# 1: First optimize PNG\noptimizedPNG=$(curl -s -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n    https://api.tinify.com/shrink \\\n    --user api:[--INSERT API KEY HERE--] \\\n    --data-binary @$IMAGE_PATH \\\n    | jq '.output.url' -r )\n\n# 2: Download optimized PNG\nwget \"$optimizedPNG\" -O $PNG_TEMP\n\n# 3: Convert to WEBP\ncwebp -q 80 $PNG_TEMP -o $ORG_FILE_NAME'.webp'\n\n# 4: Removes temp files\nrm $PNG_TEMP\n```\n\nI only changed one thing in the script, compared to the manual process. While making the script, I found that the 2. compression of the WEBP lowered the quality too much. So instead it's all handled in the conversion.\n\n## To use it our self\n\nYou can copy the script - add in a [TinyPNG api key](https://tinypng.com/developers) - [follow the guide](https://www.simplykyra.com/how-to-run-a-bash-script-from-anywhere-on-your-apple-computer/) - and then type this in a terminal:\n\n`optimtize-img.sh [--PATH TO IMAGE--]`\n\nAnd boom - your images are ready, small and fast to download!","src/content/blog/2023/are-your-images-ready-for-the-web.md","1ab3b7b1510dd3bb",{"html":338,"metadata":339},"\u003Cp>Images are heavy bits of a website.
